<p>In 2010, when I started API Evangelist, I sat down to create a logo, and after six hours of frustration in photoshop, I eventually just typed out my logo as a basic JSON representation, kind of as a joke, which I eventually planned on changing, but it stuck.</p>

<p>With the latest batch of t-shirts I've ditched the "logo" portion, but will keep this version floating around, here and there for nostalgic purposes. Along the way, I've added what I consider the function version of the logo, which I use for each of my research sites.</p>

<p>I'm starting so many new research areas lately, I decided to create a logomaker, so I can make new logos, and anyone else can make their own as well. There are three API endpoints for the API Evangelist logomaker API:</p>

<p><strong>Single</strong></p>
<script type="text/javascript">
	function generateSingle()
		{
		alert('generating!');	
		}
</script>
<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="2">
	<tr>
		<td>
			<strong>value:</strong>
			<input type="text" size="25" value="" />
			<input type="button" name="generate" value="generate" onchange="generateSingle();" />
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>
			<img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/logo-2015-02-02-11-58-00.png" width="250" />
		</td>
	</tr>
</table>
